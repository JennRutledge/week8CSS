            I am a creative designer and a logical numbers processor. 
            My interests and skills have a broad range. I have worked in the food and retail industry as well as the financial industry. My passion is design.
            I am creating this website with <code>HTML</code> for the Promineo Tech bootcamp I am currently participating in. Up to this point we have been learning about <code>JavaScript</code>.
